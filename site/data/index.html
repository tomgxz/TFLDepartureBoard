        <h1>About the Data Used by This Site</h1>
        <br>

        <h2>TFL - Underground Line Data</h2>

        <p>
            This site uses data provided by <a href="https://api.tfl.gov.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TFL's Open Data API</a>.
            The API provides information about London Underground lines, stations, and platforms, as well as many other modes of transport
            not yet used by this site. <br> <br>

            The API is not fun to use. It has a load-balancer that regularly returns data that is older than the data returned in the previous 
            request. Updates can be up to 60 seconds delayed. It provides very little and conflicting platform information, and provides very little
            documentation on using websockets. <br> <br>

            This site currently pushes regular GET requests to the API to get the latest arrival data. I am currently working on moving to 
            using websockets, but TFL provide little to no documentation on their use.

            <li>
                <strong>Lines:</strong> When the page loads, it queries the API for every tube line. <br>

            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Stations:</strong> When the page loads it queries every underground station by using the type <code>NaptanMetroStation</code>. <br>

            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Platforms:</strong> Due to the limitations of the API, getting information about platforms is quite difficult. <br>
                As a workaround, the site accesses the next arrivals at a station when it is selected by the user, and then intuits the platform information from that data.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Arrivals:</strong> Arrivals are queried per station and per line. <br>
                The interval of queries is determined by the closest train to the station by time. <br>
