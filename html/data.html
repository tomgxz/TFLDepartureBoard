        <h1>About the Data Used by This Site</h1>
        <br>

        <h2>TFL - Underground Line Data</h2>

        <p>
            This site uses data provided by <a href="https://api.tfl.gov.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TFL's Open Data API</a>.
            The API provides information about London Underground lines, stations, and platforms, as well as many other modes of transport
            not yet used by this site. <br> <br>

            The API is not fun to use. It has a load-balancer that regularly returns data that is older than the data returned in the previous 
            request. Updates can be up to 60 seconds delayed. It provides very little and conflicting platform information, and provides no
            documentation on using websockets. <br> <br>

            This site pushes regular GET requests to the API until a response is recieved from the websocket, to prevent there from being up to 30 seconds
            of wait time between selecting a platform and seeing the results.
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Lines:</strong> When the page loads, it queries the API for every tube line. <br>

            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Stations:</strong> When the page loads it queries every underground station by using the type <code>NaptanMetroStation</code>. <br>

            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Platforms:</strong> Due to the limitations of the API, getting information about platforms is quite difficult. <br>
                As a workaround, the site accesses the next arrivals at a station when it is selected by the user, and then intuits the platform information from that data.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Arrivals:</strong> Arrivals are queried per station and per line. <br>
                The interval of queries is determined by the closest train to the station by time. <br>
                Accessed via <a href="https://api.tfl.gov.uk/Line/Northern/Arrivals/9400ZZLULNB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://api.tfl.gov.uk/Line/{Line Name}/Arrivals/{Station Naptan Code}</a>
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                <strong>Websockets:</strong> To get push requests from the API, the site uses a websocket connected to <a href="https://push-api.tfl.gov.uk/signalr/hubs/signalr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://push-api.tfl.gov.uk/signalr/hubs/signalr</a>. <br>
                Because of the initial delay on the websocket, once a platform is selected by the user, the site keeps sending GET requests until the first websocket response is given.
                The documentation on this is non-existent, which made it extra fun to work out.
